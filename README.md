npm install  
```  

## Usage  
To run the program type ```npm start``` in your console while in the base route of the directory.  Open up insomnia afterwards.

These paths will allow you to create a new user, create a thought, create a reaction, add another user to the friend list, update a user, update a thought, remove a friend, delete a reaction, delete a user, delete a thought, get all or a single user, and get all or a single thought.
